# Hero section (simple)

## Responsive design 
- Partly accomplished with Tailwind, using breakpoint prefixes in utility classes, and @media queries (see [Tailwind responsive design](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design))
- Breakpoints set to 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), and 1440px (desktop)
  - Defined a new breakpoint variant using theme variable (see Tailwind [doc]) 
- Hover, focus, disabled buttons implemented
